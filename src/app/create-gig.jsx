// You'll need a screen for Gig Creation. If you don't have one in src/screens/Gigs/ yet,
// you can create a placeholder or use the GigCreationModal.jsx code I provided earlier,
// saved as src/screens/Gigs/GigCreationScreen.jsx, for example.
// For now, assuming you'll create/have GigCreationScreen.jsx:
import GigCreationScreen from '../screens/Gigs/GigCreationScreen';
export default GigCreationScreen;
// If using the modal code as a screen, ensure the component is defined and exported correctly.
